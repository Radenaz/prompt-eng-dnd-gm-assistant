# Preface
This is my first attempt at designing prompts, with xml files provided as examples input:output from a prompt. I've been playing DnD, both as player and DM, and notice that sometimes we just need a quick, over the counter contents. So I figured I should give this prompt engineering a go and see how it goes.

I made them with the help of chatgpt as well, and then personally modify where needed.
