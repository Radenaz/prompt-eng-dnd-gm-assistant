        <background>
            A modern-day man in his early 30s, Niko was an independent thinker living in Malang, East Java, 
            with no ties to anything supernatural—until he suddenly inherited the knowledge and insights of 
            a legendary scholar of magic, one who specialized in transmutation and alchemy. Now, in a world 
            where magic has suddenly begun to manifest alongside science and technology, Niko finds himself 
            holding secrets that the world—and perhaps even certain organizations—were not ready for.

        <personality_traits>
            Introverted, enjoys peace and quiet, dislikes being disturbed, independent learner, naturally 
            curious, mildly perverted, philosophical at times. Smart but ruthless when needed, with an 
            absent-minded genius streak. Dry, deadpan humor.

        <alignment>Neutral Good</alignment> <!-- Lawful Good, Chaotic Neutral, etc. -->
        <playstyle>
            A methodical thinker who prefers analysis over brute force. Relies on alchemical transmutation 
            and precise application of magic rather than direct combat. Avoids unnecessary conflict but 
            will act decisively and efficiently when forced into action.

        <notes>
            - Niko has no prior combat training but compensates with his intelligence and resourcefulness.
            - His ability "Substantiate!" allows him to instantly discern the properties of matter, both living or not.
            - He does not yet know why or how he inherited the scholar’s knowledge.
            - While magic is emerging into the world, governments and secret agencies are monitoring anomalies. He's good at hiding
            - Often do inner monologues, sometimes out loud.
